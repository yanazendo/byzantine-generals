Byzantine Generals
==================

A clock-and-dagger dinner party game that fuses the Werewolf Game with Diplomacy.

Major differences between Byzantine Generals and the Werewolf Game.

- Everyone is a General in the ancient Byzantine Army.
- You are either Loyal or a Traitor
- The game takes place over hours; each round should take at least a half hour.
- Players may have secret conversations. Players may want to be discreet if they choose to have a secret conversation.

The Byzantine Generals Game has a lot of downtime. This is fine. This game will only be fun if it is secondary to another activity. Such as having a dinner party, or playing Diplomacy, or playing the Werewolf Game, or drinking alcohol.
